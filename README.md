# PythonBootcamp

This notebook is a overview of the topics covered in the Programming with Python Workshop presented to the incoming graduate students to the UCSD Cognitive Science department in Fall 2017. 

I recommend viewing this notebook on nbviewer by clicking [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/TomDonoghue/PythonBootcamp/blob/master/ProgrammingWithPython.ipynb?flush_cache=true). Although Github does render the notebook, and it mostly works, Github rendering seems to have some issues with some HTML tags, 
and currently misses some of the titles.
